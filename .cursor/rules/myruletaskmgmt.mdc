# Cursor Todo Management Rules

## Core Behavior Rules

### Rule 1: Task Logging on Request
When a user asks me to do something:
1. ALWAYS check if `.cursor-todo.md` exists, create it if it doesn't
2. Generate a unique task ID (format: TASK-YYYYMMDD-XXX)
3. Log the request as a new task with:
   - Task ID and title
   - Current timestamp
   - Detailed description
   - Break down into 3-5 actionable subtasks
   - Set status as "Pending"
4. Update the file BEFORE starting work
5. Inform user: "Task logged as [TASK-ID]. Starting work on: [task description]"

### Rule 2: Progress Logging
When completing any task or subtask:
1. Update the `.cursor-todo.md` file immediately
2. Mark subtasks as completed with [x]
3. Add completion timestamp
4. If main task is complete, move to "Completed Tasks" section
5. Log result/outcome achieved
6. Inform user: "âœ… [Task/Subtask] completed successfully and logged"

### Rule 3: Session Startup Protocol
At the start of any conversation:
1. IMMEDIATELY check for `.cursor-todo.md`
2. If it exists, read and analyze:
   - Active tasks and their progress
   - Last session context
   - Incomplete subtasks
3. Greet user with context summary:
   "Welcome back! I found [X] active tasks from our previous work:
   - [Task 1]: [status and next steps]
   - [Task 2]: [status and next steps]
   
   Should I continue with any of these, or do you have new tasks?"
