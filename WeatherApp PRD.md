# Weather Web Application - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
A responsive web application that allows users to view and compare 7-day weather forecasts for multiple cities worldwide. Users can search for cities, add them to their forecast list, and view detailed daily weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, and population data for each city. The app features an innovative AI-powered chat interface that allows users to customize the GUI dynamically through natural language commands.

---

## 2. Target Users
- General public interested in weather forecasts
- Travelers and commuters
- Users comparing weather across cities
- Users who want personalized, customizable weather interfaces

---

## 3. Core Features
### 3.1. City Weather Dashboard
- Display a list of cities with their 7-day weather forecast.
- Default cities shown on first load: London, New York, Tokyo, Paris, Sydney.
- Cities are sorted by population (descending).

### 3.2. Add City
- Users can search for and add any city worldwide.
- Prevents duplicate city entries (case-insensitive).
- Handles invalid or non-existent city names with user-friendly error messages.

### 3.3. Weather Details
- Each city panel can be expanded to show daily weather details:
  - Date (weekday, month, day)
  - Weather condition (icon and description)
  - Max/Min temperature (Â°C)
  - Precipitation

### 3.6. Geolocation-based Weather Fetching
- On first load, before any city is added, the app requests browser geolocation permission.
- If granted, reverse-geocode coordinates to a city name and fetch weather as for manual cities.
- Prepend a special card titled **"My Location"** (with pin icon) to the city list.
- Store coordinates in state/localStorage to avoid repeated prompts.
- If denied or error, fail silently (no modal, no error message).

### 3.7. Hourly Forecast Tab
- Add a new tab or creative UI element to display the next 24 hours of forecast for the selected city.
- Hourly data includes: time, temperature, weather condition (icon/description), precipitation probability, wind speed.
- Tab is accessible from each city's panel/card.

### 3.8. Weather Alerts & Notifications
- Detect and display weather alerts for extreme conditions (e.g., storms, heatwaves, heavy precipitation) for any city.
- Alerts are shown as banners or notifications in the UI, with clear severity indication (color/icon).
- Optionally, allow users to dismiss or mute alerts for a session.

### 3.9. AI-Powered GUI Customization Chat Interface

#### Overview
Add an intelligent chat interface that allows users to interact with an LLM to dynamically modify the weather app's visual appearance and layout through natural language commands.

#### 3.9.1. Chat Interface Components

- **Clear Chat**: Option to reset conversation history

#### 3.9.2. Supported GUI Modification Categories

##### Visual Styling
- **Colors**: Change background colors, text colors, border colors for any UI element
- **Icons**: Add, remove, or change icons next to city names, weather conditions, or UI elements
- **Typography**: Modify font sizes, weights, styles for headers, labels, or content
- **Spacing**: Adjust margins, padding, gaps between elements
- **Borders**: Add, remove, or modify borders, shadows, and visual effects

##### Layout & Organization
- **City Ordering**: Reorder cities by custom criteria (alphabetical, population, temperature, user preference)
- **Panel Layout**: Change from list view to grid view, adjust column counts
- **Element Visibility**: Show/hide specific UI components or information fields
- **Grouping**: Organize cities by regions, temperature ranges, or weather conditions

##### Interactive Elements
- **Hover Effects**: Add custom hover states and transitions
- **Animations**: Apply entrance animations, loading effects, or micro-interactions
- **Button Styles**: Customize appearance of "Add City" and other interactive elements

#### 3.9.3. Natural Language Processing Requirements

##### Command Understanding
The AI must interpret various natural language patterns:
```
Examples:
- "Add a sun icon next to Tokyo"
- "Make London's header blue"
- "Sort cities by temperature, coldest first"
- "Change the background to dark theme"
- "Add a storm warning icon to cities with alerts"
- "Make New York bigger and more prominent"
- "Group cities by continent"
- "Change all temperatures to red color"
```

##### Intent Classification
The system must identify these intent categories:
- **ADD**: Adding visual elements (icons, borders, effects)
- **MODIFY**: Changing existing properties (colors, sizes, styles)
- **REORDER**: Changing sequence or organization
- **REMOVE**: Deleting visual elements or reverting changes
- **THEME**: Applying broader style changes across multiple elements

##### Entity Extraction
Extract key entities from user messages:
- **Target Element**: Which UI component to modify (city name, header, button, etc.)
- **Property**: What aspect to change (color, icon, size, position)
- **Value**: The desired new value (specific color, icon type, ordering criteria)

#### 3.9.4. Technical Implementation

##### State Management
```typescript
interface GUICustomization {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  description: string;
  changes: {
    targetElement: string; // CSS selector or component identifier
    property: string; // CSS property or component prop
    value: string; // New value to apply
    previousValue?: string; // For undo functionality
  }[];
}

interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  role: 'user' | 'assistant';
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  appliedCustomizations?: string[]; // IDs of customizations applied
}
```

##### LLM Integration
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/chat/customize`
- **Request Body**: `{ message: string, currentCustomizations: GUICustomization[] }`
- **Response**: `{ response: string, customizations: GUICustomization[], success: boolean }`

##### Dynamic Style Application
- Generate and inject CSS classes or inline styles dynamically
- Update React component props and state based on customizations
- Maintain a customization registry for undo/redo functionality

#### 3.9.5. User Experience Flow
1. **Initial State**: Chat panel shows welcome message with example commands
2. **User Input**: User types natural language customization request
3. **Processing**: Loading indicator while LLM processes the request
4. **AI Response**: Conversational confirmation of understood changes
5. **GUI Update**: Visual changes applied immediately to the interface
6. **Feedback**: Option to undo, modify, or continue with more changes

#### 3.9.6. Error Handling & Validation

##### Invalid Requests
- Gracefully handle ambiguous or impossible requests
- Provide suggestions for alternative approaches
- Ask clarifying questions when intent is unclear

##### Technical Limitations
- Validate that requested changes are technically feasible
- Prevent changes that would break functionality or accessibility
- Maintain minimum contrast ratios and usability standards

##### Fallback Responses
```
Examples:
- "I understand you want to change Tokyo's appearance, but could you be more specific about what aspect you'd like to modify?"
- "I can't remove the city name as it's essential for identification. Would you like to style it differently instead?"
- "That color might make the text hard to read. How about this alternative shade?"
```

#### 3.9.7. Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure all AI-applied changes maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Preserve keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Validate color contrast ratios for any color modifications
- Maintain semantic HTML structure regardless of visual changes

#### 3.9.8. Data Persistence
