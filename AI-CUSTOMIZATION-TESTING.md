### 4. API Tests (`test-ai-basic.ps1`)
- **Purpose**: Test backend API endpoints and responses
- **Coverage**: All customization types and error scenarios
- **Framework**: PowerShell with Invoke-WebRequest
- **Key Tests**:
  - Icon customization API
  - Background color API
  - City sorting API
  - Layout customization API
  - Animation customization API
  - Reset functionality API
  - Error handling API
  - Response time performance
  - Data structure validation

## Test Execution

- **Memory Usage**: Stable (no leaks detected)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Continuous Testing Strategy

### After Each Development Step
1. Run `.\test-ai-basic.ps1` to verify core functionality
2. Run frontend unit tests for component changes
3. Run E2E tests for UI changes
4. Verify all customization types still work

### Before Committing Changes
1. Full test suite execution
2. Performance verification
3. Cross-browser testing
4. Error scenario validation

### Weekly Regression Testing
1. Complete test suite
2. Performance benchmarking
3. Security testing
4. Accessibility testing

## Test Data

### Sample Test Commands
```
- "Add weather icons"
- "Change background to blue"
- "Sort cities by temperature"
- "Enable smooth animations"
- "Change to grid layout"
- "Increase spacing between cities"
- "Make icons bigger"
- "Reset all customizations"
- "Make the weather dance" (error test)
```

### Expected Responses
- Valid commands return appropriate customizations
- Invalid commands return helpful guidance
- All responses include proper data structures
- Error handling is graceful and informative

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Tests failing due to server not running**
   - Solution: Run `.\restart-servers.ps1` first

2. **Frontend tests failing due to missing dependencies**
   - Solution: Run `cd frontend && yarn install`

3. **E2E tests failing due to browser issues**
   - Solution: Run `cd frontend && yarn playwright install`

4. **API tests timing out**
   - Solution: Check server status and increase timeout

### Debug Mode
To run tests with detailed output:
```bash
cd frontend
yarn test --reporter=verbose
```

## Future Test Enhancements
